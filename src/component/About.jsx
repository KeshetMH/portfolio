            <p>I'm Keshet Melman Hausman, a Web Developer with a background in Project Management and Civil Engineering. 
                After recently graduating from a web development bootcamp, I am actively seeking a career transition into web development, where I can apply my coding skills and  contribute to the creation of innovative, user-centered solutions in this dynamic field.
                With years of experience, I believe the key factors that contribute to a project's success include a high level of professionalism, the ability to address challenges in real time, and strong communication skills. 
                I'm excited to bring my skills to new challenges while adapting to the evolving needs of each project.
